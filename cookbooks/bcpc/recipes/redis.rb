# For HA, we'll run additional redis-servers in slave mode so that the
# sentinel processes can agree to shuffle the slave to where they are
# needed (or promote them to masters) in the event of failures.
# For this to work in the event of network partitions, we'll need
# N/2+1 total depth for each redis partition, which means one master 
# and N/2 slaves. To do this, we get each headnode's redis slaves to slave
# to N/2 machines to the 'right' of themselves (wrapping around the Array
# if needed).
